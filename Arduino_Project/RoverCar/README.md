ü§ñ Bluetooth-Controlled Rover Car (Work in Progress)
This is my favorite project so far‚Äîa Bluetooth-controlled rover car built with an Arduino Uno and the HC-06 Bluetooth module. It‚Äôs currently under development as part of a personal and academic challenge, combining embedded systems with mobile app design.

The rover is controlled via a custom app I created using MIT App Inventor, which sends commands to the Arduino over Bluetooth. The car responds to directional inputs and also gathers data from onboard sensors.

üéØ Project Goals
Remote control of the rover via smartphone

Real-time data collection from:

Ultrasonic distance sensor (HCSR04)

Light sensor (via photoresistor or analog input)

Visual and audio feedback using:

LED indicators

Piezo buzzer

üß† Features Implemented So Far
Manual and autonomous driving modes

Movement functions: forward, backward, left, right, stop

Buzzer alerts and LED signals based on sensor input

Distance-based obstacle avoidance logic

Bluetooth command parsing and mode switching

üîß Components Used (so far)
Arduino Uno R3

HC-06 Bluetooth module

HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor

Piezo buzzer

LEDs

DC motors with motor driver

Light sensor (photoresistor)

MIT App Inventor mobile app

üõ†Ô∏è Status
This project is still in progress‚ÄîI'm actively refining the code, improving the app interface, and testing sensor integration. More updates and documentation will be added soon!
