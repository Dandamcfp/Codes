🔁 Palindrome Checker in ANSI C (No Libraries Used)
This project is a simple palindrome checker written entirely in ANSI C, developed as part of a college assignment around August 28th, 2025. What makes it special is that all string manipulation was implemented manually—no external libraries or built-in string functions were used. Every comparison, reversal, and character count was coded from scratch.

🧠 How It Works
Reads a full line of text from the user.

Reverses the string using a custom recursive function.

Compares the original and reversed strings character by character.

If the input is "FIM", the program exits gracefully.

💡 Why It Matters
This project was a personal and academic challenge to deepen my understanding of low-level string operations in C. Instead of relying on functions like strcmp() or strrev(), I built the logic myself—from handling null terminators to recursive reversal.
